Of course, it depends on a lot of factors, but by learning to deal with stress and getting this experience, you will gain confidence and gain readiness.  Sometimes you may forget about it and focus on how you are a person who is stuck in suffering instead of seeing your own strength.  Consider yourself someone who is better prepared for life than an ordinary person because you have lived so much."),

Instead of how long am I going to survive this? 2- Know your strengths and use them In general, people who are more flexible tend to use their strengths.

          name: "Mental presence as a strategy to deal with life's stresses",
          image: "5",
          details: "Research shows that stress anxiety has evolved to help motivate you to get the job done, by increasing your energy and focus.  Instead of focusing on getting rid of the stress itself.  Which can lead you to irrational strategies that weaken rather than improve your psychological well-being.  You can acknowledge that your response to pressure may serve your values.  Looking at the phenomenon (post-traumatic growth) may give us an example of the process by which experiencing stress and adversity eventually leads to positive results, such as: a deep social bond after an intense quarrel with a spouse, a greater appreciation of life after a health crisis.  This third step involves embracing the idea that stress can enhance your well-being in the long run. This does not mean that you are blind to the fact that burnout can occur as a result of it, but that you are aware of the possibility of achieving a high level of well-being, not despite the stress but perhaps  because of her."),

These processes are not mutually exclusive.  In the sense that you can catch someone's smile to feel happy for you too because of the emotional infection, and evaluate the situation as positive considering that his emotional reaction is the result of his evaluation of the current situation, and this smile is also a motive to repeat the action that provoked his smile in the beginning."),

And how important it is for us not to see things with our own eyes.")

    title: "California Mysticism",
    describ: "Los Angeles artist Ariana Papademetropoulos will lure you into a painted fairy tale—one that hovers winkingly between the romantic and the foreboding. Papademetropoulos, who is 30 and was born and raised in Pasadena, makes seductively beautiful, large-scale paintings that brim with the symbols and attributes of girlhood, Hollywood, and a very Southern California brand of the occult. Four-poster beds, unicorns, and glistening soap bubbles that call to mind Glinda the Good Witch all make appearances. A meticulous technician, Papademetropoulos’s works are often described as hyper-realistic, yet the canvases are the first to signal their own illusory nature, with trompe-l’oeil watermarks or torn edges offering viewers a path into or out of her dreamlike universes Over the past decade, she has earned a devoted following. Papademetropoulos graduated from CalArts in 2012 and worked as a studio assistant for the figurative painter Noah Davis; the late artist gave her her first break when he included her in a show he curated at Roberts Projects in Los Angeles in 2010. In 2019, she earned plaudits for a solo exhibition at The Breeder gallery in Athens (Papademetropoulos is of Greek and Argentine descent). Just last year, in 2020, she transformed Vito Schnabel Gallery in New York into a lushly colorful installation with her exhibition “Unweave a Rainbow.”",

    describ: "All the paintings start from a source image, yes. For this show, it mostly was all vintage postcards, ranging from the 1920s to the ’60s. I collect books. I love interior design books. Each painting is such a different type of process and they all take so much time. For instance, the exhibition includes a painting with a boat. I was thinking about making that boat painting like, three years ago. In that case, I just had a picture that I found in National Geographic of a man in a boat, and I just put it on my wall and kept coming back to it. I collect a lot of source imagery and I just kind of wait until it’s the moment. But it all comes from real postcards and physical images. I feel like the internet is too vast for me to figure out in terms of researching images. I need the boundaries of it coming from a real place. I can connect ideas more and become more creative, in a way. ",

    describ: "The award-winning fashion designer Christian Siriano has made his name creating fantastical, out-of-this-world gowns that sometimes resemble artworks as much as they do dresses After winning Project Runway’s fourth season and founding his eponymous label in 2008, the 35-year-old designer has become one of the fashion world’s most tapped young talents. Clients including Lady Gaga, Michelle Obama, Angelina Jolie, Cardi B, and Scarlett Johansson regularly turn up on the red carpet outfitted in sculptural pieces that reflect his love of, and background in, the visual artsIn 2018, Siriano dressed a record 17 women at the Academy Awards. The following year, the actor Billy Porter debuted one of the designer’s most renowned creations—a tuxedo jacket from which bloomed a strapless, full-skirted velvet black gown—at the Oscars, becoming that year’s most Google-searched red-carpet look and cementing Siriano as a designer who cares deeply about inclusivity in fashion.",

    describ: "In describing her attitude toward museum work, Beckwith often resorts to an anecdote. The painter “Frank Bowling writes very intentionally about how it is so important to be committed to change from the inside,” she says, before offering a metaphor the artist Melvin Edwards once shared with her. Referring to a barbed-wire installation of his, he said: “You’re going to get nicked, you’re going to get cut sometimes, you’re going to bleed sometimes,” she paraphrases. “But you’ve got to be prepared for that. Because the reward of having walked through that barbed wire should be far greater not just for yourself, but for the entire field and for history, than just insisting that there’s a better way. You’ve got to demonstrate a better way. And you have got to put in that work at the place where it needs to be done.In her first extensive interview since she began at the Guggenheim, Artnet News spoke with Beckwith about how she identifies artists who matter, how trustees shape the culture of an institution, and why we need to change the way we think about art.
